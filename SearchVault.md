🔍 **Offline Search Tool (Prototype)**A pre-fed search interface that mimics memory-based recall.

Enter a keyword or topic, and the tool fetches saved/bookmarked summaries you've "viewed earlier" — simulating offline personal search.

📌 **How to Use this Tool**

1. Enter any keyword or phrase you’ve previously viewed or saved — like
    
    ➤ *“India space mission”*, *“Time & Work”*, *“Quantum Physics”*
    
2. (Optional) Choose a category to narrow down the search:
    
    ➤ Notes, AFCAT, IR, News, Personal
    
3. The tool will fetch the **closest matching saved result** from your manual memory base
4. You can update or add your own entries to expand your searchable “memory”
