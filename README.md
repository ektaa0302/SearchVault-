# SearchVault- Offline Memory Search Tool

**SearchVault** is a prototype tool designed to simulate human-like memory recall. Built in Notion, it allows users to search for previously “saved” content using keywords, mimicking an offline search experience.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Enter a keyword (e.g., *“India space mission”*, *“Time & Work”*, *“Quantum Physics”*)
2. (Optional) Select a category: Notes, IR, AFCAT, News, Personal
3. The tool returns a saved summary or note from your “memory base”

All results are **pre-fed** in this version but simulate real-time memory-based searching.
